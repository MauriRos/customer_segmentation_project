# 🎯 Customer Segmentation Project

This project applies **customer segmentation techniques** using marketing analysis to identify distinct groups of consumers based on demographic and purchasing behavior. The main focus is to utilize **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Clustering (K-Means)** to create customer profiles that can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📂 Project Contents

- **Customer Segmentation**: Classifies customers into meaningful groups to optimize marketing campaigns.  
- **Visualization**: Detailed visualizations (heatmaps, distributions, 3D plots) to explore customer behavior.  
- **Analysis**: Insightful analysis of cluster characteristics (e.g., income, age, family size, education).

## 📂 File Descriptions

- **marketing_campaign.csv**: Contains customer data, including features such as age, income, number of children, education level, and more.
- **customer_segmentation_project.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook where the segmentation analysis is performed. This file includes steps from data loading to result visualization, including data cleaning, PCA application, and K-Means clustering.
- **images/**: A folder containing the plots generated during the analysis, such as 2D and 3D scatter plots of the clusters, the elbow method visualization for determining the optimal number of clusters, and others.

## 📊 Results

The analysis results in customer segmentation based on key characteristics, enabling the creation of distinct customer profiles. Highlights include:
- **Distributions by Customer Group**: Comparative analysis of features like income, age, and education across different segments.
- **Cluster Profiles**: Detailed descriptions of each cluster, showcasing their unique traits.
- **Visualizations**: 2D and 3D scatter plots to explore clusters and the relationships between features.
